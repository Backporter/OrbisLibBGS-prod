do not take anything in this library as fact when it comes to names, logic, it still needs to be heavily fixed, it does however work.

PS4/Orbis is the only natively supported platform

building with OOSDK causes a crash, so you need to use the leaked sony SDK(sad),

to build with sony SDK download/clone xUtilty and rename the folder to OrbisUtil and build it, open CSEL/CSEL.vcxproj in VS 2015, hit build on "CSEL", once done, a folder named ConvertPRX2SELF/CUSA30258-app/ should be in the root dir, that wil contain the PRX

thanks to maany of those in the OOSDK discord for the help in setting up this prx and for helping me with code and assembly
